# QUARK  🐣

## 💡 **🚀 QUARK – Bootcamp Project Research Task: Building an Automatic Deployment Platform** 🚀  

Hey everyone! 👋🏽 Today, we officially kick off research for **Project QUARK**, an open-source **Automatic Deployment Platform** designed to make deploying our FastAPI projects seamless and automated here in [3D & Robotics lab](https://github.com/udsm-3d-robotics-studio)!  

🔥 **Why “QUARK”?**  
Quarks are the **fundamental building blocks of protons and neutrons in the universe**, just as **QUARK** will be the foundation for automated deployments in our lab and beyond. **We’re solving a real-world challenge—simplifying deployments for ourselves first, with a vision to open-source it for others facing the same problem!**  

🚀 **What We’re Building:**  
We’ll use **FastAPI** for the backend and **React** (or Flutter for mobile UI) for the frontend. The platform will enable **GitHub-based deployments**, integrating **Docker and Kubernetes** for managing containers, with **SSH automation** for deployment control on remote servers.  

🛠 **Research Topics (In Groups of 2):**  
All groups will **research the best Python libraries** to integrate FastAPI with **server resource control and deployment automation** at a production level.  

👥 **Group Tasks:**  
1️⃣ **Industry Research – Deployment Automation & DevOps Approaches**  
   🔹 How do companies like Render, Vercel, and Heroku structure their deployment automation?  
   🔹 What best practices should we adopt for QUARK?  

2️⃣ **Server Resource Control Libraries & SSH Automation**  
   🔹 Explore **Fabric, Paramiko, PyInfra, Ansible**, or other tools that can integrate with FastAPI for managing remote deployments over SSH.  
   🔹 How do these libraries compare, and which is best for QUARK?  

3️⃣ **Kubernetes & Docker for Deployments**  
   🔹 How should we **integrate Docker & Kubernetes** into our tool for automated deployment & container orchestration?  
   🔹 What are the best strategies for managing FastAPI-based microservices?  

4️⃣ **FastAPI Webhooks & GitHub Integration**  
   🔹 How can we trigger deployments when a **GitHub repository** is updated?  
   🔹 Research **GitHub Webhooks, Actions, and FastAPI event handling** for seamless CI/CD automation.  

5️⃣ **Frontend Architecture & User Experience**  
   🔹 What UI/UX considerations should we make for an intuitive deployment platform?  
   🔹 How do existing DevOps platforms design their dashboards?  

⚡ **Deliverables:**  
Each group will present their findings with key takeaways on **what tools we should use and why**. This research will set the foundation for **building QUARK into something powerful!**  

Let’s make this happen! 🚀🔥 #QUARK #Innovation #Bootcamp

## **QUARK – General Project Overview**  

We are developing **QUARK**, an **Automatic Deployment Platform** similar to Render, specifically for **FastAPI-based API projects**. The platform will allow users to:  

✅ **Connect a GitHub repository** for seamless integration  
✅ **Deploy & manage FastAPI projects automatically**  
✅ **Use Docker & Kubernetes** for efficient containerized deployment  
✅ **Automate deployments via SSH on remote servers**  
✅ **Provide a user-friendly interface** to manage projects  

💡 **Tech Stack:**  
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Fabric/Paramiko/Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes  
- **Frontend:** React (for JS devs) & Flutter (for possible mobile UI)  
- **Infrastructure:** GitHub Webhooks, CI/CD, Cloud/On-Prem Deployment
